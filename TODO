## Simpler tasks

Consider determining initial vdesk from focussed window.

Allow specifying a matrix for vdesk organisation, e.g., "-numvdesks 4x2".  Add
C+A+Up/Down controls to navigate them.


## Intermediate tasks

Investigate SHAPEd windows for client sweep/drag.  As it stands, non-solid
drags and all sweeps draw a border by inverting pixels on the screen, erasing
by re-inverting.  This requires the X server to be grabbed, which is
undesirable.

Although the current methods work well enough, it would be nice to not have to
grab the X server so often.  e.g., when adding or removing a client, maintain a
set of windows that the error handler should treat differently.

RandR-based multi-monitor support has now been implemented, but it would be
nice if, when a client is moved due to removing a monitor, it could be moved
back to its original position if the _same_ monitor is reattached.  Whether a
monitor is the "same" is probably just down to whether it occupies the same
geometry on the screen.
