Title: minimalist window manager for X11
Author: Ciaran Anscomb <evilwm@6809.org.uk>
Abstract: evilwm - minimalist window manager for X11
 evilwm is based on aewm by Decklin Foster. It's minimalist 
 in that it omits unnecessary stuff like window decorations 
 and icons. But it's very usable in that it provides good 
 keyboard control with repositioning and maximize toggles, 
 solid window drags, snap-to-border support, and virtual desktops.
